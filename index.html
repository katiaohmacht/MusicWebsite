    Music Measures in a nonprofit organization that teaches piano and music theory to children at the Boys & Girls Club of Stamford. Our founders and volunteer instructors have received quality music education and continue to experience the joy of expressing themselves through music. Our mission is to spread the joy of music with children who may not otherwise have the means and provide them with the foundations to develop a life-long skill.

    When the COVID-19 pandemic began, Music Measures completely transformed to our current virtual format. A permanent infrastructure was established at the Yerwood Center with labeled keyboards, cameras, and a monitor. With the tremendous help of Mike Halley, current Program Director at the Boys & Girls Club of Stamford, and our team of volunteer instructors, we have been conducting virtual lessons ever since. We will hopefully be able to resume in person lessons in Fall 2022!

    In 2015, Music Measures was founded by Neerav, Abhinav, and Meeta Kumar. They fundraised for 15 keyboards and devised a music curriculum. With the help of Maribel Sandalo, former Director of the Boys & Girls Club of Stamford, they began teaching in person lessons to 30 children. The lessons culminated into student performances at the Yerwood Center during the final Gala.
